# 2016 Weather Analysis

## Project Goals

The 2016 Weather Data Exploratory Analysis project was started to review the raw data from NOAA and identify areas of uncertainty and their potential impact on reaching a greater than 95% scientific certainty.

This project is designed to analyze NOAA observation stations across the planet that record temperature data in terms of:

Geographic density of stations
Geographic diversity of stations
Consistency of station reporting
Completeness of station observations
The anaylsis also includes a review of the raw weather data used by NOAA for the year 2016 in terms of:

Geographic density of observations
Geographic diversity of observations
Consistency of observations
Completeness of observations
Finally, the project will review the methodologies used by NOAA to determine their appropriateness, effectiveness, and scientific validity.

## Reproducability

The project has been designed to be educational and reproducable. All code required to perform the analysis is included in the GitHub repo and published on RPubs. Towards that end, all data handling, manipulation, processing, summarizing, and analyzing is fully detailed along with the locations for all source files and related documentation. In addition, a large amount of collateral documentation has been generated and available in the Reports section.

Because of the educational nature of the project, the code narrative may be verbose at times. The intent is to adequately detail the processing and provide sufficient explanation for those less familiar with the data or the coding process. It is recommended to read the associated blogs referenced in the reports along with the companion documentation and related articles, journals, or papers linked as well.

The project has been broken into multiple sub-tasks based on function. These can include data cleaning, data processing, data exploration, data visualization, methodology testing, report generation, validation testing, and other tasks. The reason for this is to keep individual sub-tasks manageable in size and focused on specific objectives. It is hoped that it also allows for a better education experience for those wishing to replicate the study on their own.
